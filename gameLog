6:30 PM 3/13/2017
	Discussed the game plot and layout of the class hierchy with Aaron.

8:15 PM
	Left to get food.
	Log out.

9:40 PM 3/16/2017
	Starting to look at the implementation and want to start with a clean slate
	Creating class Item.

10:15 PM
	Ran into brief roadblock, looking into the requirements of D-level to focus on the basics
	By roadblock I mean, not sure what to prioritize
	- Looking into the Room class and how to hold the items.
	
10:23
	With regard to the NPC we want to make, wondering if we should have their presence
	determined by boolean and "flip" it to change their location OR make an NPC class with
	the killer as an instance, they would then change rooms by being put into that room's list.

	In the latter case, the killer could have it's own current room and search that room for
	exits, randomly choosing one to go through. In that sense, it's location could be managed
	by the game class. BUT that seems like bad coupling.

10:34
	Looking into parser impl. Nevermind, looking at the Game class and then deciding on a
	rough layout of our Rooms

10:41-50
	Writing description of game, also had an idea about character builds and the ability to hide.

10:57
	Adding files to GitHub for initial commit. Ending session.

3:00 PM 3/17/2017
	Starting review of Zuul before Friday submission. Goals, get published to GitHub, determine the
	logs of each participant, address current needs in the program, make progress on the naming and
	structure of the rooms in our Game.map.

	Discussed what would be necessary to keep in our logs as we don't want to be redundant.

3:04
	Brainstorming the storage and creating of rooms:
	- Create and set each exit manually
	- Have one method that takes variable parameters
		- OR a list that has all of the info in one line
	- 
Side note: can add a method to Room called addScene, that would allow for variable descriptions,
	this would be coupled with changeScene which would replace or alter the current description in some way.

	Going to focus on the Game.java class specifically for the turn in today.

3:15
	Wondering if logically there is any way to have the parser handle the commands, or to separate 
	Command from Game or Command from Parser to reduce coupling. It seems redundant to have the class
	connected to both Parser and Game.
	
3:20
	Thinking about the room's fields and the parameters it needs to be created, and what it needs for other scenes
	The constructor will only be able to do a limited amount of what we want to implement
	if it only takes a parameter of longDescription. Would it be better then to have methods
	that create the other scenes, make exits, etc, or to have some of this handled by the constructor.

	- Have a default descripton for rooms that haven't been implemented.
	
3:27
	Going to abstract our map into a separate class so that we can keep the engine and possibly use
	it on different versions of the game.

3:46
	Thinking about the map class and getting the rooming situation sorted out.

3:54 PM
	Turning in now. NOTE: the game does not work, but it does compile. That is all.
	Logging Off.

7:26 PM 3/22/2017
	Log in.
	Aaron working on minigames. Gavin working on class hierchy and some implementation of Game, Map, Item
	Thinking that the map will hold each room and that currentRoom may become a string that is used as a key.
	This has the benefit of keeping the rooms associated with Map and not game directly.

	Want to have the currentRoom var held in each player's fields, rather than inside of game. This has the
	benefit of making it easier to have multiple players controlled by the environment. The main player
	may still have a current room associated with themselves inside of game class, but ideally not. We shall see.

	Side note: I understand why game has access to command words now. I think we can change it. Later.

8:00
	Deciding against having Map class, but want to keep it.

8:28
	Is it worthwhile to keep the current room inside of player? When I think about adding other players,
	I think it is, but game has to provide the information to change player location because Game
	has access to Map.

	It's not worthwhile to have a Map class. making change now.

9:33
	Think that I have travel sorted out.

10:34
	Working on how to have NPC choose an exit, was returning a Set, but no way of choosing one thing within
	a set that I can tell. So I'm changing it to an Array (don't need ArrayList)

10:56
	Forgot how to set length of array. Didn't include "new" oops.

11:15
	Have working version. Very basic, can move through rooms, NPC moves. Need to work on Item and interactions.
	Have decent hierchy in order. Going to sync with Aarons work.
